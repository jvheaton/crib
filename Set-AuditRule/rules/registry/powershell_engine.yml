notes:
    - Audit Rule cannot be applied to HKLM:\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\PowerShell\1\PowerShellEngine directly. Audit rule needs to be applied to HKLM:\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\PowerShell\1\ with `InheritanceFlag` set to `ContainerInherit`
    - Audit Rule cannot be applied to HKLM:\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\PowerShell\3\PowerShellEngine directly. Audit rule needs to be applied to HKLM:\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\PowerShell\3\ with `InheritanceFlag` set to `ContainerInherit`
    - In a Windows 10 computer (PS version 5), HKLM:\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\PowerShell\3\PowerShellEngine is queried every time the PowerShell console is opened.
