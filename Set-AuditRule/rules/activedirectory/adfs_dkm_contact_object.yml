title: ADFS DKM Contact Object
id: 76E5E58A-F721-4ADE-9312-B5F3EB9B2B3C
status: experimental
description: A threat actor would need to export the DKM master encryption key in order to decrypt AD FS certificates. Stealing the AD FS token signing certificate would allow someone to impersonate a user in a federated environment. Creatinga SACL on the contact object that contains the DKM master encryption key would help to audit any direct access attempt.
